			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers who violate the provisions of the Code of Regulations for Teachers and the TSC Code of Conduct and Ethics will face disciplinary action which may include warning or interdiction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #133154;"><strong>Disciplinary Process</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>A Head of institution may initially issue a verbal warning or caution the teacher in writing on minor breaches.</li>
<li>In case of persistent misbehaviour, the teacher may be required to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him/her.</li>
<li>From the teacher’s response, the head of institution may serve the teacher with a warning or present the case before the agent.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #133154;"><strong>The agent shall;</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Investigate and assemble relevant evidence.</li>
<li>Invite the accused teacher in writing to defend himself/herself against specified allegation.</li>
<li>Call witnesses to give evidence in the presence of the accused teacher.</li>
<li>Allow the teacher to cross-examine each witness.</li>
<li>In case of desertion where teacher’s whereabouts is unknown, the agent will interdict without any delay.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #133154;"><strong>After the preliminary hearing the agent may reach any of the following decisions;</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>No case to answer.</li>
<li>Warn the teacher administratively.</li>
<li>Interdict the teacher.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #133154;"><strong>NB:</strong></span> In some cases TSC or agent can interdict a teacher without inviting him/her for preliminary hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An interdicted teacher should write a defense statement within 21 days from the date of interdiction and provide contact address. A case will normally be heard within three months after interdiction. In case of delay the teacher is advised to make enquiries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #133154;"><strong>Salary during interdiction</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers interdicted on cases of incitement, insubordination, infamous conduct and negligence of duty will be paid half salary during the period of interdiction</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Transfer requests are normally considered for approval by the Appointment Board, once, at the end of the year. However, the Commission can transfer a teacher at its discretion. A teacher wishing to be considered for transfer should do so by:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Filling in a transfer application form through the head of institution. Transfer forms are available at TSC offices countrywide or can be downloaded from TSC website.</li>
<li>Completed application forms should be sent to the TSC or its agents by the head of institution.</li>
<li>Transfers for primary school teachers within the county will be handled by the TSC County Director.</li>
<li>Transfers outside the county will be handled by the TSC headquarters. Applications for transfer for tertiary institutions are processed at the TSC headquarters.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Transfer requests submitted to the Commission will be acknowledged promptly. The decision of the Appointment Board will later be communicated to the teacher. Transfers will be granted subject to availability of vacancy and replacement.</p>]]></description>
